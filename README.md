# Node Info

`Nodeinfo` is a library for serving up instance information using [the NodeInfo standard](http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software)

> NodeInfo is an effort to create a standardized way of exposing metadata about a server running one of the distributed social networks. The two key goals are being able to get better insights into the user base of distributed social networking and the ability to build tools that allow users to choose the best fitting software and server for their needs.
